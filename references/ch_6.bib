They require incredible tolerance along with tight control on surface roughness. For example in case of refractive optics 1 micron r.m.s. shape error and {\textless}100 nm Sa surface roughness is needed on mm-scale geometries. Femtosecond laser ablation paired with inline metrology is a promising method to achieve the required parameters. Due to short pulse duration the workpiece experiences less thermal stress which is beneficial when it comes to the possibility of internal stress and crystal lattice damage. Various materials from tungsten to diamond can be processed with lasers. Combined with secondary operations like polishing laser microfabrication can be utilized in various state of the art components required for X-Ray community. In this presentation we will review several applications in refractive optics: diamond CRL, phase plates and others.},

The system relies on the X-ray speckle tracking principle to accurately measure the phase gradient of the X-ray beam from which beam optical aberrations can be deduced. The key component of this instrument, a semi-transparent scintillator emitting visible light while transmitting X-rays, allows simultaneous recording of two speckle images at two different propagation distances from the X-ray source. The speckle tracking procedure for a reference-less metrology mode is described with a detailed account on the advanced processing schemes used. A method to characterize and compensate for the imaging detector distortion, whose principle is also based on speckle, is included. The presented instrument is expected to find interest at synchrotrons and at the new X-ray free-electron laser sources under development worldwide where successful exploitation of beams relies on the availability of an accurate wavefront metrology.},

For nano-focusing mirrors, height errors in the mirror surface retard or advance the X-ray wavefront and after propagation to the focal plane, this distortion of the wavefront causes blurring of the focus resulting in a limit on the spatial resolution. We describe here the implementation of a method for correcting the wavefront that is applied before a focusing mirror using custom-designed refracting structures which locally cancel out the wavefront distortion from the mirror. We demonstrate in measurements on a synchrotron radiation beamline a reduction in the size of the focal spot of a characterized test mirror by a factor of greater than 10 times. This technique could be used to correct existing synchrotron beamline focusing and nanofocusing optics providing a highly stable wavefront with low distortion for obtaining smaller focus sizes. This method could also correct multilayer or focusing crystal optics allowing larger numerical apertures to be used in order to reduce the diffraction limited focal spot size.},

    abstract = {The vertical intensity distribution of synchrotron-based X-ray beams usually has a Gaussian profile encompassing large intensity variations. For biomedical imaging applications this may entail sub-optimal dose distributions and large fluctuations in terms of image noise. Commonly, planar metallic filters coupled with absorbing slits systems are applied to adjust the delivered flux and to limit intensity variations, respectively. The latter results in a reduction of the effective beam size. A flattening filter that counterbalances the transverse inhomogeneity, while retaining a sufficient flux, has been developed in the context of a monochromatic phase-contrast breast computed tomography application, ongoing at the Elettra synchrotron facility. The implementation of the new filtration system results in homogeneous intensity (hence dose) distribution and signal-to-noise ratio across the imaged volume. Finally, and most importantly, it allows a wider portion of the beam to be used, directly translating into a major (∼40{\%}) reduction of the overall scan time for samples requiring a field of view larger than the beam size ( i.e. multiple translation steps).},

Several planned soft X-ray and tender X-ray insertion-device beamlines in the Advanced Light Source upgrade rely on a common design principle. A flat, first mirror intercepts the white beam; vertical focusing is provided by a variable-line-space monochromator; and horizontal focusing comes from a single, pre-figured, adaptive mirror. A variety of scenarios to cope with thermal distortion in the first mirror are studied by finite-element analysis. The degradation of the intensity distribution at the focal plane is analyzed and the adaptive optics that correct it is modeled. The range of correctable wavefront errors across the operating range of the beamlines is reported in terms of mirror curvature and spatial frequencies. The software developed is a one-dimensional wavefront propagation package made available in the OASYS suite, an adaptable, customizable and efficient beamline modeling platform.},

Thin Cr layers were deposited on flat substrates by DC magnetron sputtering. The substrates were moved in front of a beam-defining aperture. The required velocity profile was calculated using a deconvolution algorithm. The Cr thickness profiles were measured directly using hard X-ray reflectivity data. The surface figure was characterized using conventional visible-light metrology instrumentation (long trace profiler) before and after the deposition. The method converges quickly, and after two iterations the mirror surface figure had improved by a factor of 7. The surface roughness evolves with increasing Cr thickness and deteriorates the quality of subsequent multilayer coatings. The mirror curvature can change upon coating, which complicates the interpretation of the surface metrology data. In this context, the role of layer stress is discussed. Potential improvements of the process are also proposed.},

Using these findings the expected focusing performance of current Be CRLs are modeled for relevant X-ray energies and bandwidths and it is shown that a correction of aberrations can be realised without prior lens characterization but simply based on the derived lens deformation. The performance of aberration-corrected Be CRLs is discussed and the applicability of aberration-correction demonstrated over wide X-ray energy ranges.},

    abstract = {During the last years X-ray refractive lenses with various design have been manufactured from mono-crystalline diamond by laser ablation with ultra-short laser pulses. The present paper shortly reviews diamond lenses with high acceptance which are intended for transportation of radiation at high-power X-ray accelerator sources. Planar, linear and two-dimensional lenses with parabolic or spherical shape were manufactured and tested at laboratory and synchrotron X-ray sources in focusing and imaging modes. Surface morphology and material quality were also analyzed both with X-ray and conventional methods. Considerations on ways to improve the quality of surface and shape are presented.},

    abstract = {Diamond features a unique combination of outstanding physical properties perfect for numerous X-ray optics applications, where traditional materials such as silicon fail to perform. In the last two decades, impressive progress has been achieved in synthesizing diamond with high crystalline perfection, in manufacturing efficient, resilient, high-resolution, wavefront-preserving diamond optical components, and in implementing them in cutting-edge X-ray instruments. Diamond optics are essential for tailoring X-rays to the most challenging needs of X-ray research. They are becoming vital for the generation of fully coherent hard X-rays by seeded X-ray free-electron lasers. In this article, we review progress in manufacturing flawless diamond crystal components and their applications in diverse X-ray optical devices, such as X-ray monochromators, beam splitters, high-reflectance backscattering mirrors, lenses, phase plates, diffraction gratings, bent-crystal spectrographs, and windows.},

    abstract = {A refractive phase corrector optics is proposed for the compensation of fabrication error of X-ray optical elements. Here, at-wavelength wavefront measurements of the focused X-ray beam by knife-edge imaging technique, the design of a three-dimensional corrector plate, its fabrication by 3D printing, and use of a corrector to compensate for X-ray lens figure errors are presented. A rotationally invariant corrector was manufactured in the polymer IP-S TM using additive manufacturing based on the two-photon polymerization technique. The fabricated corrector was characterized at the B16 Test beamline, Diamond Light Source, UK, showing a reduction in r.m.s. wavefront error of a Be compound refractive Lens (CRL) by a factor of six. The r.m.s. wavefront error is a figure of merit for the wavefront quality but, for X-ray lenses, with significant X-ray absorption, a form of the r.m.s. error with weighting proportional to the transmitted X-ray intensity has been proposed. The knife-edge imaging wavefront-sensing technique was adapted to measure rotationally variant wavefront errors from two different sets of Be CRL consisting of 98 and 24 lenses. The optical aberrations were then quantified using a Zernike polynomial expansion of the 2D wavefront error. The compensation by a rotationally invariant corrector plate was partial as the Be CRL wavefront error distribution was found to vary with polar angle indicating the presence of non-spherical aberration terms. A wavefront correction plate with rotationally anisotropic thickness is proposed to compensate for anisotropy in order to achieve good focusing by CRLs at beamlines operating at diffraction-limited storage rings.},
