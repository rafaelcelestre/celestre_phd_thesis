\chapter{Effect of optical imperfections on an X-ray beam}
\label{sec:effect_optical_imperfections}

The effects of the optical imperfections modelled and measured in Chapter~\ref{sec:measuring} to a X-ray beam are presented in this chapter in terms of fully- and partially- coherent simulations done with the \textit{SRW} code and the specially developed Python library for refractive optics (barc4RefractiveOptics) presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:modelling}. The fully-coherent simulations are composed of the beam-caustics and the point-spread function (PSF - intensity and phase) for the system being modelled. Partially-coherent simulations comprise the beam characteristics at the image plane and the beam profile at selected positions along the optical axis. These simulations are used to extensively evaluate the performance of commercially available Be lenses; compare the validity of individually measured and artificially stacked lenses against the stack measurement; and the different effects of distinct spatial frequency ranges in figure errors to the optical performance of the CRL.

\section{Lenses and lens stacks}\label{sec:lens_descripiton}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The modelled lenses are 2D-Be lenses with a nominal radius of $R=50~\mu\text{m}$ chosen as representative of lenses used widely at beamlines at many synchrotrons - see Fig.~\ref{fig:1D2D_lenses}(b) and (d). Such lenses have typically 1~mm thickness and are held in a 2~mm thick lens frame, which delimits the spacing $\Delta\text{s}=2~$mm between individual lenses in Eq.~\ref{eq:TE_CRL_MS_ERR}. Those lenses can be manufactured with wall thickness in the range of $\sim30~\text{to}~40~\mu\text{m}$. Applying Eq.~\ref{eq:A}, one obtains $A_{\diameter}\le440 \mu\text{m}$. At 8~keV, the energy used for the simulations, the index of refraction for Beryllium is $n=1-5.318\times10^{-6}+i\cdot2.071\times10^{-9}$ and the corresponding intensity transmission of this lenslet is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectiveAperure}(a). Applying Eq.~\ref{eq:CRL_classic} with $N=1$, one obtains the focal length for a single lens: $f_{\text{lens}}=4.701$~m. The lens stacks used are composed of $N=10$ lenses, except by the stackes used in the simulations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDn01-05-10}, where the number of lenses $N$ varies ($N=1,5,10$).  The lens stack focal distance can be obtained by applying Eq.~\ref{eq:CRL} with $N=10$ and $L=(N-1)\cdot2~\text{mm}=18~\text{mm}$: $f_{\text{CRL}}=473~{\text{mm}}$, giving a magnification of approximately $126:1$ ($M\approx8\times10^{-3}$ for a source 60~m away from the CRL) and a diffraction-limited spot size (Eq.~\ref{eq:PSF}) of $\sim200~\text{nm}$. The error profiles used for the simulations have been described in \S\ref{sec:single_lens}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:single_lens}} when measured individually and in \S\ref{sec:lens_stack}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:lens_stack}} when measured as a 10-element stack.

The comparison between the simulations using individually measured lenses against simulations using metrology from a lens stack is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack} for lenses L01-L10 and in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDo_vs_CDoStack} for the lenses L11-L20. Simulations of a single lens (L01), five stacked lenses (L01-L05) and ten stacked lenses (L01-L10) are used to investigate the deterioration of the X-ray beam profile upon stacking lenses. These can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDn01-05-10}. The effect of different spatial frequency ranges in the X-ray beam is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnFF_LF_HH}, where the performance of the accumulated figure error profile of lenses L01-L10 is compared against the performance of its decomposition in Zernike circular polynomials and the residues of such fit. Finally, the lens stack formed by individually measured lenses L01-L10 is meticulously studied under fully- and partially-coherent illumination. Figure~\ref{fig:CDnS} shows transverse cuts along the optical axis, the beam caustics, PSF (intensity and phase) and the demagnified image of the X-ray source (CPMU18\footnote{Cryogenic Permanent Magnet Undulator.}).

\section{Software and computing infrastructure}\label{sec:SRW}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

All simulations presented here were done using the "Synchrotron Radiation Workshop" (SRW) [\cite{Chubar1998}]\footnote{Available at \url{https://github.com/ochubar/srw}}, as it conveniently offers the possibility of fully- and partially-coherent calculations\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:wave_propag}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:wave_propag}} and \S\ref{sec:partially_coherent}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:partially_coherent}}.}, and presents native parallelisation with the MPI standard [\cite{Chubar2011}]. Fully coherent calculations were done using a single CPU of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz, while partial coherent simulations used 28 CPUs of the same computer infrastructure (NICE OAR cluster at the ESRF). The specially developed python library for dealing with the refractive lenses with the addition of optical imperfections (barc4RefractiveOptics) presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:modelling} was also used in the simulations.

(a) shows the X-ray source: a CPMU18 undulator. An (b) ideal parabolic phase element with radius of curvature $R=-60~$m is placed 60~m downstream the radiation source to give the illumination a near-plane phase - cf. Eq.~\ref{eq:planewave}. This ideal element is only present for the fully-coherent simulations. The lenses being studied are shown in (c). They are immediately followed by a set of (d) slits to ensure the same geometric aperture for all simulations and aid direct calculation of the Strehl ratio. For the fully-coherent simulations, the beam-caustic range is shown in (e) and the PSF is calculated at the centre of it. For the partially-coherent simulations, the beam profile evolution along the optical axis is shown in (f) and the beam characteristics at the focal position are calculated at the its centre.

\section{Fully coherent simulations}\label{sec:coherent_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this set of simulations, the X-ray source is a filament electron-beam passing through a CPMU18 undulator with 111 magnetic periods, $\Lambda=18$~mm magnetic period and magnetic field $B=0.9863~$T emitting a 1$^\text{st}$ harmonic photon beam at 8~keV (resonance). The photon source size and divergence are given by the specific radiation
pattern size and divergence of the insertion device and the emission is fully coherent\footnote{cf. \S\ref{sec:optical_coherence}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:optical_coherence}}.}  - see \S\ref{sec:brilliance}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:brilliance}}. At 60~m away from the source, the beam footprint\footnote{Although commonly approximated by Gaussian distributions, undulator emission does not posses Guassian distribution not even at resonance. Please, refer to footnote \ref{note:und_prof} in \S\ref{sec:brilliance}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:brilliance}} for a deeper discussion on the emission profile of undulator radiation and for further references.} is large enough to illuminate the full geometric aperture of a lens with $A_{\diameter}\le440 \mu\text{m}$ with an intensity variation of 2\% (centre to the edge). The illumination profile in conjunction with the transmission profile of the lenses being modelled (Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectiveAperure}) allows to classify such systems as apodised. In the paraxial approximation, the radiation phase for this source is dominated by a quadratic phase term [\cite{Chubar1999, Chubar2001b, Chubar2019}]. At the position along the optical axis where the intensity is calculated, this quadratic phase term can be compensated by placing an ideal lens with focal length focal length $f=-60~$m. This ensures a plane-wave illumination (Eq.~\ref{eq:planewave}) downstream the ideal element, which is used to illuminate the different CRL models being studied. The lens stack and imperfect lenses are modelled using the CRL multi-slice approach with errors added described by Eq.~\ref{eq:TE_CRL_MS_ERR} and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:models}(c) in \S\ref{sec:CRL_modelling}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:CRL_modelling}}. The evaluation of the effect of optical imperfections on an X-ray beam is performed at the image plane of the focusing system and on its vicinity. The beamline used for the fully-coherent simulations is shown in  Fig.~\ref{fig:optical_setups}.

\subsection{The PSF: ideal focusing}\label{sec:psf_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After passage through the CRL model being studied, the plane wave used for illuminating the optical system will develop a quadratic phase term that has a curvature radius equivalent to the effective focal distance of the optical system, which is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:CRL}. The propagation of the wavefront from the exit pupil of the CRL to the image plane located a focal length distance is equivalent to an optical 2D-Fourier transform of the system pupil function. The PSF of the optical system corresponds to the squared modulus of this Fourier transform, which is the wavefront intensity at the focal plane, considering a plane wave illumination [\cite[\textit{\S2.3.1} \& \textit{\S6.2}]{Goodman2017}]. The phase of the propagated field at the focal position, the normalised PSF and relative intensities of the aberrated PSF normalised to the ideal case (Strehl ratio) are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}-\ref{fig:CDo_vs_CDoStack}(b-c) and (e);  Fig.~\ref{fig:CDn01-05-10}(b)-(d); Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnFF_LF_HH}(c)-(e); and Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnS}(d)-(e). The calculated FWHM of the central lobe of the PSF for the simulated models presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}-\ref{fig:CDnS} are displayed on Table~\ref{tab:beamsizes} and the respective Strehl ratio, compiled in Table~\ref{tab:Strehl}.

\subsection{The beam caustics}\label{sec:caustics_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The beam characteristics at the image plane are very important and the PSF simulations in Figs.~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}~to~\ref{fig:CDnS} show obvious differences between ideal and aberrated focusing of CRLs. It is necessary, however, to complement this with investigations of the effect of optical imperfections away from the focal position, especially because several experimental applications may use a defocused beam. To get an overview of the beam evolution up- and downstream the focal position, one can propagate the wavefront along the optical axis and for each position extract a cross-section of the beam. This will be referred to as the beam caustic\footnote{Strictly speaking, the beam caustic is the envelope of light rays after passing through an optical element - see p.~60 [\cite{Lawrence1972}]. A more comprehensive theory of caustics in optics is given by [\cite{Kravstov1999, Nye1999}].}. The beam caustics are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}-\ref{fig:CDn01-05-10}(a); Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnFF_LF_HH}(b); and Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnS}(c). The beam cross-section for selected positions along the beam optical axis can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnS}(b). The vertical cuts were taken at $x=0$. The zero position along the optical axis is given by the distance from the centre of the CRL to the image plane, position where the PSF is calculated. To calculate the beam caustics, the wavefront was propagated from 10~mm upstream the focal position to 10~mm downstream in 4001 equally spaced steps along the optical axis.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Partially coherent simulations}\label{sec:partcoherent_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PSF and beam caustic simulations presented previously are both fully-coherent calculations. They present the focusing of a perfect plane wavefront to a diffraction-limited spot. This shows the intrinsic limitations of the optical system, but inherently neglects the effects of an extended and partially coherent source.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{X-ray source}\label{sec:source_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The emission of a single electron passing through an undulator (filament beam) is fully coherent. By changing the electron initial conditions (positions, direction and energy), propagating the emission of this electron through the beamline and adding up intensities, one can simulate partially coherent radiation if the electron beam phase space (5D) is sufficiently sampled as discussed in \S\ref{sec:partially_coherent}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:partially_coherent}} - see also [\cite{Chubar2011}]. 

For this section, a hypothetical beamline operating on the new Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) magnetic lattice [\cite{orangebook}] is implemented. This beamline is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:optical_setups}. The beamline sits on a straight section and has a CPMU18 undulator as an insertion device. The undulator was tuned to its first harmonic at 8~keV for all simulations. The photon source size is $\sim71.92\times12.38~\mu\text{m}^2$ and its divergence $\sim17.66\times14.72~\mu\text{rad}^2$ (FWHM, horizontal vs. vertical). The first optical element was placed 60~m downstream of the centre of the undulator to ensure a beam footprint larger than the geometric aperture of the CRL being studied ($A_{\diameter}\sim440~\mu\text{m}$) and a constant intensity over it. The transverse coherence length $\Delta_{\textbf{cl}_{\perp}}$ at the entrance of the optical system is estimated to be $\sim60\times448~\mu\text{m}^2$ (FWHM, horizontal vs. vertical), from the calculation of the complex degree of spatial coherence\footnote{see \textit{Spatial coherence} in \S\ref{sec:optical_coherence}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:optical_coherence}}.} $j(\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2)$. If there is no spatial filtering, the horizontal direction is less coherent than in the vertical, leading to stronger blurring of the image in the less coherent direction [\cite[\textit{\S7.5}]{Goodman2017}]. 
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{On the convergence of the simulations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a conservative approach, the partially coherent simulations presented here were done using 10$^{4}$ wavefronts to ensure convergence.
The convergence of the partially-coherent simulations is connected to the sampling of the electron distribution $f(s,s',\gamma_e)$, where each electron in a bunch has a different initial condition in terms of position $s=(x_e,y_e,z_e=0)$, direction $s'=(x'_e,y'_e)$ and energy $\gamma_e$ - see \textit{Physical-optics-based methods} in \S\ref{sec:partially_coherent}~-~\textit{\nameref{sec:partially_coherent}}. \todo{Fig.~\ref{fig:ME_convergence} shows the sampling of the function $f(s,s',\gamma_e)$ for the ESRF-EBS, the old ESRF-low $\beta$ and the old ESRF-high $\beta$ straight sections.}

\subsection{Beam characteristics at the focal position}\label{sec:source_image_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The image of the extended X-ray source is similar to the convolution between the geometrically demagnified image of the source and the 2D-PSF of the imaging system, provided the beam is not strongly cropped anywhere in the beamline being simulated. For the cases being studied here, the beam footprint at the entrance pupil of the CRL system is several times larger than the geometric aperture of a single lens and this convolution approach is not valid, hence the necessity of the partially-coherent simulations for imaging the centre of the CPMU18. Figures~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}-\ref{fig:CDo_vs_CDoStack}(e) and Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnS}(f) show the normalised demagnified image of the undulator photon source while Table~\ref{tab:beamsizes} presents the horizontal and vertical FWHM for those simulations. Figures~\ref{fig:CDn_vs_CDnStack}-\ref{fig:CDo_vs_CDoStack}(f) show graphical representation of the Strehl irradiance ratio, as the intensities of the aberrated models are normalised to the peak intensity of the aberration-free CRL model. These values are compiled in Table~\ref{tab:Strehl}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Beam profile evolution along the optical axis}\label{sec:partcaustics_sim}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating the full beam caustic with partially-coherent simulations is impractical using current simulation methods and computers/clusters especially if: \textit{i}-)  the beamline does not present a very high degree of coherence, thus requiring a very large number of wavefronts to accurately simulate the partial-coherence; \textit{ii}-) the beamline has low transmission (strong beam cropping, diffraction orders outside apertures); or \textit{iii}-) the sampling along the optical axis is high. Still, many applications require to operate up- or downstream of the focal position and assessing the beam quality on such positions is essential. Figure~\ref{fig:CDnS}(a) shows the beam profile evolution spanning 20~mm along the optical axis for selected positions up- and downstream the image plane. Images are displayed showing their relative intensity to the beam in the focal plane. The positions chosen were the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDnS}(b), selected cuts along the beam caustics, so direct comparison between fully- and partially-coherent simulations can be done.

The main results drawn from the simulations presented previously are discussed in this section. Firstly, some considerations on the effect of optical imperfections on a (partially) coherent X-ray beam are drawn. The merit of using the Strehl ratio for X-ray lenses tolerancing is also discussed. Finally, some comments on the simulation times are done.

\subsection{The effect of optical imperfections}\label{section:discussion_imperfections}

Applying the Mar\'echal criterion (Eq.~\ref{eq:MarechalCriterion}) calculated for Beryllium lenses illuminated at 8~keV requires the accumulated projected figure errors to be $\sigma_z\leq2.08~\mu\text{m}$. Tables~\ref{tab:CDn} and \ref{tab:CDo} show that the accumulated thickness for both stacks is larger and that the optical system is operating far from ideal as the system exceeds the limit imposed by the Mar\'echal criterion.

% The addition of the mid- and high-spatial frequency errors ($\sigma_z\sim1.77~\mu\text{m}$) are related to scattering around the focused beam, contributing thus to increased background and consequently reducing the peak intensity following \citename{Harvey1995a}~\citeyear{Harvey1995a}. Using a linear scale, both the ideal PSF and the demagnified source image in Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_ideal}(e)-(f) are indistinguishable from their aberrated counterparts in Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_HF}(e)-(f), which is due to the fact that the accumulated figure error complies to the Mar\'echal criterion.  When considering the low-spatial-frequency figure errors ($\sigma_z\sim4.91~\mu\text{m}$), however, concentric faint rings start appearing on the PSF. Homogeneous concentric rings on the PSF are a classical signature of spherical aberration, which is a major component of the LF figure errors - cf. $Z_{11}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase}(g). The predominance of spherical aberration on 2D parabolic Be lenses has already been observed; see Fig.~ 6.14 of \citename{Seiboth2016b}~\citeyear{Seiboth2016b}. The PSF due to spherical aberration can be seen also in Figs.~8.5 and 8.6 from \cite{Mahajan2011}. In the partially-coherent simulations, the rings around the main lobe seen at the PSF simulations are stretched horizontally to the point that their visibility is maintained vertically, but horizontal cuts (Fig.~\ref{fig:MEsimulations}(b)) show almost no trace of them, due to the reduction in transverse horizontal coherence (blurring effect). Small misalignments between the lenslets and some residual tilt from the LF errors contribute to a lateral displacement of the beam in the image plane - this is observed also in Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_LF}(e) and \ref{fig:simulations_FF}(e). Using the full-frequency-range figure errors ($\sigma_z\sim5.22~\mu\text{m}$) yields a combined effect that is analogous to the superposition of the HF and LF figure errors. The CRL-FF model can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulations_FF}. The diffraction effects from the aperture of the CRL are not easily observable because the system has an apodised Gaussian intensity at the exit pupil \cite{Mahajan1986}.
% %We can conclude that at the focal position, the addition of the optical imperfections does not greatly change the beam profile, confirming that the CRL make for good transport optics and moderate focusing.

% The addition of figure errors change the beam profile more significantly  up- and downstream of the focal position. Fig.~\ref{fig:simulations_ideal}(a)-(c) show the focusing done by the multi-slicing model of the CRL without any optical imperfections. Introducing the HF errors does not significantly change the beam shape as they contribute to the scattering of light outside the beam envelope defined by the beam caustics - cf. Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_HF}(a)-(c). The LF errors act to change the beam shape dramatically as can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_LF}(a)-(c) and Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_FF}(a)-(c). Upstream of the image plane, a persistant central lobe is observed, albeit much less intense, with a high background around it thus reducing the signal to noise ratio. Downstream, the beam has a drop in intensity in the middle, looking like a doughnut when a cut transverse the optical axis is made. This behaviour is observed both on fully- and partially-coherent simulations. Such beam caustics have been extensively reported by experimental groups working under high coherent conditions, with similar optics and ptychographic reconstruction of X-ray beams - cf. Fig.~3 in \cite{Schropp2013}, Fig.~2 in \cite{Seiboth2016} and Fig.~3 in \cite{Gasilov2017}.

\subsection{The Strehl ratio for X-ray lenses}\label{section:discussion_strehl}

% The Strehl ratio for the CRL models is presented in Table~\ref{tab:Strehl}. In the numerical simulations, the intensity at the centre of the beam is normalised to the intensity obtained by a single-lens equivalent system. Due to this fact, the CRL-MS model has slightly more intensity in the central peak than the single-lens equivalent ($\sim0.9\%$ and $\sim0.4\%$ for the coherent and partially-coherent cases, respectively), which is explained by the fact that the X-rays are continuously being focused inside the CRL\footnote{This effect is negligible for a short CRL, but it can become important when the number of elements is drastically increased \cite{Schroer2005}.} - cf. \cite{Schroer2005}.

% Our results show (Table~\ref{tab:Strehl}) that applying the Strehl ratio calculated from analytic equations (Eqs.~\ref{eq:Strehl}-\ref{eq:Mahajan}) overstates the effect of moderate figure errors on the overall system performance. In order to understand the dependency of the numerically simulated Strehl ratio versus height error r.m.s. we used the CRL-MS+HF model and scaled each individual figure error (Table~\ref{tab:LensSpecs}) by a constant value to allow for a scanning of the total projected figure error $\sigma_z$. The results in Figure~\ref{fig:Strehl} show the expected Strehl ratio as a function of the projected figure errors $\sigma_z$ for different analytical approximations (Eqs.~\ref{eq:Strehl}-\ref{eq:Mahajan}) and for the numerical calculations with a fully- and partially-coherent illumination. All approaches show very good agreement up to $S_\text{ratio}>0.8$, when they start diverging. The expressions for $S_\text{ratio a}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:Strehl}) and  $S_\text{ratio b}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:Marechal}) can be considered as approximations for $S_\text{ratio c}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:Mahajan}), therefore are only expected to be valid over a restricted range (large $S_\text{ratio}$). A fit of the simulation data  (coral rhombuses and blue squares in Fig.~\ref{fig:Strehl}) give:
% \begin{subequations}\label{eq:Strhel_Exp_pre}
% \begin{align}
%     S_{\text{ratio coh.}}&\approx\exp{\big(-2.32\cdot10^{10}\sigma_z^2 -6.13\cdot10^4\sigma_z + 2.54\cdot10^{-2}\big)},\\
%     S_{\text{ratio part.-coh.}}&\approx\exp{\big(-2.28\cdot10^{10}\sigma_z^2 -5.07\cdot10^4\sigma_z + 2.29\cdot10^{-2}\big)}.
% \end{align}
% \end{subequations}
% Unfortunately, due to the nature of the projected figure errors (in the range of few micrometres r.m.s.), we are not able to discard the non-quadratic terms. We can rewrite Eqs.~\ref{eq:Strhel_Exp_pre} as:
% \begin{align}\label{eq:Strhel_Exp}
%     S_{\text{ratio simulation}}&\approx\exp{\bigg[- \bigg(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\bigg)^2\big(\kappa_1\Delta\Phi\big)^2-\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\kappa_2\Delta\Phi-\kappa_3\bigg]},
% \end{align}
% where $\kappa$ are scaling constants that, in principle, the number of elements, lens material, energy and, mostly importantly, the spatial distribution of the accumulated errors over the optical element aperture. For our particular examples, $\kappa_1=0.71$, $\kappa_2=0.28$ and $\kappa_3=2.54\cdot10^{-2}$ for the coherent case and $\kappa_1=0.70$, $\kappa_2=0.24$ and $\kappa_3=2.29\cdot10^{-2}$ for the partially-coherent case. When comparing Eq.~\ref{eq:Strhel_Exp} with Eq.~\ref{eq:Mahajan}, a $\kappa<1$ suggests that there is some weighting of the phase errors reducing their effect, but simply multiplying the accumulated phase errors (cf. Table~\ref{tab:LensSpecs}) with the normalised optical system transmission (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:EffectiveAperure}) does not allow prediction of $\kappa$ and we leave this as an open question at the time of writing.

% Following the recent discussion about the pertinence of the $S_\text{ratio}\geq0.8$ as an indicator of optical quality for the X-ray regime and the performance of such optical systems away from the focal position \cite{Cocco2015, Cocco2019}, we can observe from our simulations (Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_ideal}-\ref{fig:simulations_FF}) that in terms of wavefront preservation, X-ray lenses are apparently more susceptible to the low-frequency figure errors, as they are the ones that change the beam profile up- and downstream the focal position. The high-frequency errors lead to scattering of the beam and speckles, but generally, do not change the beam shape even away from the focal position. It is clear from Figs.~\ref{fig:simulations_LF} and \ref{fig:simulations_FF} that the Strehl ratio encountered at the focal position (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:MEsimulations}) is not preserved up- or downstream from it. Fortunately, the low frequencies are those which can be readily corrected by the fitting of corrective optics \cite{Seiboth2017}. Corrective plates aim at increasing the Strehl ratio in the low-frequency range, leaving the high-frequencies as the bottleneck for corrected systems performance.


\subsection{Simulation time}\label{section:discussion_time}

% Increasing the complexity of the simulation model comes at the expense of increasing the overall simulation time, but as long as the transverse wavefront sampling is maintained, memory consumption is not affected from one model to another. The time increase in the simulations is mainly due to: \textit{i}) increase in the number of drift spaces and the number of optical elements; \textit{ii}) from reading the densely sampled metrology data. Table~\ref{tab:simulation_time} presents the typical simulation times for this work. Those are particularly high because the transverse sampling of the wavefronts is several times larger than the nominal minimal sampling necessary to mitigate artefacts or under-resolved features on the wavefront. Employing 10$^{4}$ wavefronts for the partially coherent simulations is also exaggerated, but was done to ensure that any changes on the simulation come from the change of model being studied and not from statistical nature of the sampling of the electron-beam phase-space. The simulation times presented on Table~\ref{tab:simulation_time} can be certainly be reduced without loss of accuracy by adopting a more sensible sampling.
