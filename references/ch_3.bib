To get a projection of the structure in a direction parallel to the b axis, for example, holes are drilled in a brass plate in the positions of cross-grating spectra. Each X-ray reflexion hol is represented by a hole the area of which is proportional to F (hol). When a parallel monochromatic beam passes through these holes, and then through a lens, the Fraunhofer fringes build up an image of the crystal structure which can be viewed through a microscope. Since a wide range of holes is required, arid they are one or two millimetres apart, the smallest holes must be very fine. I am indebted to Dr. E. W. Fish for supplying me with a series of minute drills.},

@article{Gorenstein2010,
    abstract = {Focusing X-ray telescopes have been the most important factor in X-ray astronomy's ascent to equality with optical and radio astronomy. They are the prime tool for studying thermal emission from very high temperature regions, non-thermal synchrotron radiation from very high energy particles in magnetic fields and inverse Compton scattering of lower energy photons into the X-ray band. Four missions with focusing grazing incidence X-ray telescopes based upon the Wolter 1 geometry are currently operating in space within the 0.2 to 10 keV band. Two observatory class missions have been operating since 1999 with both imaging capability and high resolution dispersive spectrometers. They are NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which has an angular resolution of 0.5 arc seconds and an area of 0.1 m 2 and ESA's XMM-Newton which has 3 co-aligned telescopes with a combined effective area of 0.43 m 2 and a resolution of 15 arc seconds. The two others are Japan's Suzaku with lower spatial resolution and non-dispersive spectroscopy and the XRT of Swift which observes and precisely positions the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. New missions include focusing telescopes with much broader bandwidth and telescopes that will perform a new sky survey. NASA, ESA, and Japan's space agency are collaborating in developing an observatory with very large effective area for very high energy resolution dispersive and non-dispersive spectroscopy. New technologies are required to improve upon the angular resolution of Chandra. Adaptive optics should provide modest improvement. However, orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved only by employing physical optics. Transmitting diffractive-refractive lenses are capable theoretically of achieving sub-milli arc second resolution. X-ray interferometry could in theory achieve 0.1 micro arc second resolution, which is sufficient to image the event horizon of super massive black holes at the center of nearby active galaxies. However, the physical optics systems have focal lengths in the range 10 3 to 10 4 km and cannot be realized until the technology for accurately positioned long distance formation flying between optics and detector is developed.},

    abstract = {Fresnel zone plates for x-ray focusing optics are typically made using lithographic techniques. To achieve optimum efficiency for hard x rays, a depth of several microns is required, which limits the minimum zone width and hence minimum focal spot size achievable using lithography. We are exploring the fabrication of zone plates by an alternative technique that surmounts these limitations: the growth of a multilayer film to be used in transmission (Laue) diffraction geometry, in which the thickness of consecutive layers gradually increases according to the Fresnel zone formula; the film is sectioned after growth to the required depth. For a planar multilayer, this produces a linear zone plate that can focus x rays in one dimension. Here we report the growth and characterization of a depth-graded multilayer suitable for use as a zone plate for hard x-ray focusing. The multilayer has a total of 470 alternating layers of WSi2 and Si with thicknesses increasing monotonically from 15 to 60 nm, for a total thickness of 11.33 $\mu$m. One of the major challenges is to understand and select the right material system for this kind of thick multilayer. We have found that WSi2 Si is a promising system. A comparison between WSi2 Si and WSi multilayers is presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

These silicon lenses are mechanically robust and can withstand high heat load of the white X-ray beam at third generation synchrotron radiation sources. For the first time we designed and manufactured a new type of lenses: kinoform lenses and parabolic lenses with scaled reduction of curvature radii. The theoretical background for such type of lens features is presented. Focusing properties in the terms of focus spot and efficiency of all these lenses were tested at the ESRF beamlines. Magnified imaging with planar lenses was realized. Some future developments are discussed.},

The focal length, estimated and confirmed by experiment, is F = 18 cm for planar parabolic lenses. The lenses with minimized absorption have shorter focal length F = 16.8 cm, showing a 5 $\mu$m recorded source image.
