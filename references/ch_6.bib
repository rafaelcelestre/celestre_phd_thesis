@article{Antipov2020,
    abstract = {Fabrication of optics components for x-ray applications is arguably one of the most challenging production tasks. They require incredible tolerance along with tight control on surface roughness. For example in case of refractive optics 1 micron r.m.s. shape error and {\textless}100 nm Sa surface roughness is needed on mm-scale geometries. Femtosecond laser ablation paired with inline metrology is a promising method to achieve the required parameters. Due to short pulse duration the workpiece experiences less thermal stress which is beneficial when it comes to the possibility of internal stress and crystal lattice damage. Various materials from tungsten to diamond can be processed with lasers. Combined with secondary operations like polishing laser microfabrication can be utilized in various state of the art components required for X-Ray community. In this presentation we will review several applications in refractive optics: diamond CRL, phase plates and others.},
