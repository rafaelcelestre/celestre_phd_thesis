    abstract = {X-ray scanning microscopy relies on intensive nanobeams generated by imaging a highly brilliant synchrotron radiation source onto the sample with a nanofocusing X-ray optic. Here, using a Gaussian model for the central cone of an undulator source, the nanobeam generated by refractive X-ray lenses is modeled in terms of size, flux and coherence. The beam properties are expressed in terms of the emittances of the storage ring and the lateral sizes of the electron beam. Optimal source parameters are calculated to obtain efficient and diffraction-limited nanofocusing. With decreasing emittance, the usable fraction of the beam for diffraction-limited nanofocusing experiments can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared with modern storage ring sources. For a diffraction-limited storage ring, nearly the whole beam can be focused, making these sources highly attractive for X-ray scanning microscopy.},

@article{Yabashi2014,
    abstract = {Developments of X-ray optics for full utilization of diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs) are presented. The expected performance of DLSRs is introduced using the design parameters of SPring-8 II. To develop optical elements applicable to manipulation of coherent X-rays, advanced technologies on precise processing and metrology were invented. With propagation-based coherent X-rays at the 1 km beamline of SPring-8, a beryllium window fabricated with the physical-vapour-deposition method was found to have ideal speckle-free properties. The elastic emission machining method was utilized for developing reflective mirrors without distortion of the wavefronts. The method was further applied to production of diffraction-limited focusing mirrors generating the smallest spot size in the sub-10 nm regime. To enable production of ultra-intense nanobeams at DLSRs, a low-vibration cooling system for a high-heat-load monochromator and advanced diagnostic systems to characterize X-ray beam properties precisely were developed. Finally, new experimental schemes for combinative nano-analysis and spectroscopy realised with novel X-ray optics are discussed.},

@article{Sutter2017,
    abstract = {The shapes of single lens surfaces capable of focusing divergent and collimated beams without aberration have already been calculated. However, nanofocusing compound refractive lenses (CRLs) require many consecutive lens surfaces. Here a theoretical example of an X-ray nanofocusing CRL with 48 consecutive surfaces is studied. The surfaces on the downstream end of this CRL accept X-rays that are already converging toward a focus, and refract them toward a new focal point that is closer to the surface. This case, so far missing from the literature, is treated here. The ideal surface for aberration-free focusing of a convergent incident beam is found by analytical computation and by ray tracing to be one sheet of a Cartesian oval. An `X-ray approximation' of the Cartesian oval is worked out for the case of small change in index of refraction across the lens surface. The paraxial approximation of this surface is described. These results will assist the development of large-aperture CRLs for nanofocusing.},
