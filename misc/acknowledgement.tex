% I do not really know when I discovered I wanted to have a career in science. It could have been one of the many Saturdays my mother brought me to her lab to "play with the microscopes" while she had to work, the numerous science kits my dad got me when I was little or that time in 1995 I dressed up as a "crazy scientist" for carnaval in Brazil. But as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a lumberjack, I mean, a physicist.
