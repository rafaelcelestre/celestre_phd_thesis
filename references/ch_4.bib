    abstract = {Fresnel zone plates are frequently used as focusing and imaging optics in x-ray microscopy, as they provide the ease of use of normal incidence optics. We consider here the effects of tilt misalignment on their optical performance, both in the thin optics limit and in the case of zone plates that are sufficiently thick so that volume diffraction effects come into play. Using multislice propagation, we show that simple analytical models describe the tilt sensitivity of thin zone plates and the thickness at which volume diffraction must be considered, and examine numerically the performance of example zone plates for soft x-ray focusing at 0.5 keV and hard x-ray focusing at 10 keV.},

    abstract = {X-ray grating interferometry was first developed in context with x-ray phase contrast imaging. Here we focus on applications where 1- and 2-dimensional grating interferometers are used to measure the distortions of x-ray wave fronts with extreme sensitivity. This allows for the in-situ and at wavelength characterization on x-ray optics such as mirrors and refractive lenses. Angular sensitivities down to the 10 nrad range can be obtained. We point out some specific concerns when using the technique in context with metrology. A precise rotational alignment is essential for accurate, absolute measurements of the local wavefront radius of curvature. Moreover, in many cases no flat-field image can be recorded, therefore the gratings need to fulfill very stringent requirements with respect to distortions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Sawhney2013,
    abstract = {Modern third-generation synchrotron radiation sources provide coherent and extremely bright X-ray beams, but the performance of the optics employed on the beamlines is critical for the X-rays' successful exploitation. The quality of the beam delivered to the sample is limited by the optics' imperfections and misalignment. Though the optics are accurately evaluated in metrology labs equipped with visible-light-based measuring instruments, such ex-situ characterizations do not allow perfect predictions of their beamline performance, since the mechanical and thermal strains imposed by beamline operation cannot be perfectly modelled. In-situ at-wavelength characterization is the natural way to overcome this limitation [1]. In-situ wavefront sensing performed at the optics' operating wavelength ("at-wavelength" metrology) can be used not only to optimize the performance of X-ray optics, but also to correct and minimize the collective distortions of upstream beamline optics (e.g., monochromator, windows, etc.). This issue has become even more critical with the increasing use of active optics on the beamlines on one hand, and with the desire to achieve diffraction-limited and coherence-preserved beams [2] on the other. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Kawal Sawhney, Hongchang Wang, John Sutter, Simon Alcock and Sebastien Berujon.

In this work, two phase-contrast imaging methods, grating- and speckle-based imaging, that measure the derivative of the phase shift, have been implemented with a laboratory source and compared experimentally. It was found that for the same dose conditions, the speckle-tracking differential phase-contrast images have considerably higher contrast-to-noise ratio than the grating-based images, but at the cost of lower resolution. Grating-based imaging performs better in terms of resolution, but would require longer exposure times, mainly due to absorption in the grating interferometer.},

    abstract = {X-ray phase contrast and dark-field imaging techniques provide important and complementary information that is inaccessible to the conventional absorption contrast imaging. Both grating-based imaging (GBI) and speckle-based imaging (SBI) are able to retrieve multi-modal images using synchrotron as well as lab-based sources. However, no systematic comparison has been made between the two techniques so far. We present an experimental comparison between GBI and SBI techniques with synchrotron radiation X-ray source. Apart from the simple experimental setup, we find SBI does not suffer from the issue of phase unwrapping, which can often be problematic for GBI. In addition, SBI is also superior to GBI since two orthogonal differential phase gradients can be simultaneously extracted by one dimensional scan. The GBI has less stringent requirements for detector pixel size and transverse coherence length when a second or third grating can be used. This study provides the reference for choosing the most suitable technique for diverse imaging applications at synchrotron facility.},

    abstract = {X-ray phase and dark-field imaging techniques provide complementary and inaccessible information compared to conventional X-ray absorption or visible light imaging. However, such methods typically require sophisticated experimental apparatus or X-ray beams with specific properties. Recently, an X-ray speckle-based technique has shown great potential for X-ray phase and dark-field imaging using a simple experimental arrangement. However, it still suffers from either poor resolution or the time consuming process of collecting a large number of images. To overcome these limitations, in this report we demonstrate that absorption, dark-field, phase contrast, and two orthogonal differential phase contrast images can simultaneously be generated by scanning a piece of abrasive paper in only one direction. We propose a novel theoretical approach to quantitatively extract the above five images by utilising the remarkable properties of speckles. Importantly, the technique has been extended from a synchrotron light source to utilise a lab-based microfocus X-ray source and flat panel detector. Removing the need to raster the optics in two directions significantly reduces the acquisition time and absorbed dose, which can be of vital importance for many biological samples. This new imaging method could potentially provide a breakthrough for numerous practical imaging applications in biomedical research and materials science.},

    abstract = {A suitably large coherence area is important in coherent X-ray optics, when using techniques such as interferometry or phase contrast imaging (PCI). The work done by Suzuki using a prism interferometer to measure X-ray coherence at 12.4 keV [1] is here extended to consider the use of a diffuser at the bio-medical imaging energy of 25 keV. In order to achieve a broader, more even X-ray field and eliminate speckle, a spinning piece of paper may be used as a rotating random-phase screen to diffuse the hard X-ray beam, but this will concomitantly decrease the magnitude of the complex degree of second-order coherence. We also study the effect of source size and source-to-sample distance on coherence, where imaging area and required flux must be considered. Coherence measurements at the 20XU beamline at the SPring-8 synchrotron are compared to results from wave-optical computer modelling. These show that while the diffuser will decrease the magnitude of the complex degree of coherence, further free-space propagation will lessen this effect. In the design of an experiment, the collimating slit size and use of a diffuser must therefore be balanced with distance from the source, in order to maximise coherence while maintaining the desired field of view and exposure time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that this contrast can be eliminated through random phase plates, which provide an effective way of tailoring the angular size of the source. The possibilities of this very simple technique for imaging phase objects in the hard x-ray range are explored experimentally and discussed.

    abstract = {IN conventional radiography, X-rays which pass through an object along different paths are differentially absorbed, and the intensity pattern of the merging beam records the distribution of absorbing materials within the sample. An alternative approach is phase-contrast radiography, which instead records variations of the phase of the emerging radiation. Such an approach offers improved contrast sensitivity, especially when imaging weakly absorbing samples. Unfortunately, current phase-contrast imaging techniques generally require highly monochromatic plane-wave radiation and sophisticated X-ray optics, so their use is greatly restricted. Here we describe and demonstrate a simplified scheme for phase-contrast imaging based on an X-ray source having high spatial (but essentially no chromatic) coherence. The method is compatible with conventional polychromatic micro-focus X-ray tube sources, is well suited to large areas of irradiation can operate with a lower absorbed dose than traditional X-ray imaging techniques, and should find broad application in clinical, biological and industrial settings.},

    abstract = {X-ray radiographic absorption imaging is an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and materials science. For biological tissue samples, polymers or fibre composites, however, the use of conventional X-ray radiography is limited due to their weak absorption. This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast. However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes. In this letter, we report how a setup consisting of three transmission gratings can efficiently yield quantitative differential phase-contrast images with conventional X-ray tubes. In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mechanically robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view. Our method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiography. It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms. {\textcopyright}2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Munro2012,
    abstract = {X-ray phase contrast imaging has overcome the limitations of X-ray absorption imaging in many fields. Particular effort has been directed towards developing phase retrieval methods: These reveal quantitative information about a sample, which is a requirement for performing X-ray phase tomography, allows material identification and better distinction between tissue types, etc. Phase retrieval seems impossible with conventional X-ray sources due to their low spatial coherence. In the only previous example where conventional sources have been used, collimators were employed to produce spatially coherent secondary sources. We present a truly incoherent phase retrieval method, which removes the spatial coherence constraints and employs a conventional source without aperturing, collimation, or filtering. This is possible because our technique, based on the pixel edge illumination principle, is neither interferometric nor crystal based. Beams created by an X-ray mask to image the sample are smeared due to the incoherence of the source, yet we show that their displacements can still be measured accurately, obtaining strong phase contrast. Quantitative information is extracted from only two images rather than a sequence as required by several coherent methods. Our technique makes quantitative phase imaging and phase tomography possible in applications where exposure time and radiation dose are critical. The technique employs masks which are currently commercially available with linear dimensions in the tens of centimeters thus allowing for a large field of view. The technique works at high photon energy and thus promises to deliver much safer quantitative phase imaging and phase tomography in the future.},

@article{Tian2020,
    abstract = {The speckle-based X-ray imaging technique (SBT), which includes the three imaging modalities of absorption, phase contrast and dark field, is widely used in many fields. However, the influence of the grain size of the diffuser, the coherence of the X-ray source and the pixel size of the detector on the multi-mode imaging quality of SBT is still woefully unclear. In this paper, the whole SBT process is simulated and the influence of these three factors on image quality is discussed. Based on this discussion, the grain size of the diffuser for SBT applications should be limited by the pixel size of the detector and the coherence length of the X-ray source. According to analysis of the noise signal and correlation map, a suitable grain size is an indispensable condition for high-quality SBT images, because an excessively small or large grain size degrades the resolution of the imaging results and generates false signals. In addition, the power spectral density of the measured raw speckle patterns demonstrates that a smaller grain can better retain high-frequency information from an imaged sample. The simulated and experimental results verify these conclusions. The conclusions of this work will be helpful in designing suitable experimental setups for SBT applications and have the potential to promote the performance of SBT in other applications, such as X-ray optics metrology and coherence measurement.},
