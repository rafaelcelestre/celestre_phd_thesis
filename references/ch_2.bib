    abstract = {An analysis of the coherence properties of the fourth-generation high-energy storage rings with emittance values of 10 pm rad is performed. It is presently expected that a storage ring with these low emittance values will reach diffraction limit at hard X-rays. Simulations of coherence properties were performed with the XRT software and an analytical approach for different photon energies from 500 eV to 50 keV. It was demonstrated that a minimum photon emittance (diffraction limit) reached at such storage rings is $\lambda$/2$\pi$. Using mode decomposition it is shown that, for the parameters of the storage ring considered in this work, the diffraction limit will be reached for soft X-ray energies of 500 eV. About ten modes will contribute to the radiation field at 12 keV photon energy and even more modes give a contribution at higher photon energies. Energy spread effects of the electron beam in a low-emittance storage ring were analysed in detail. Simulations were performed at different relative energy spread values from zero to 2 × 10 −3 . A decrease of the degree of coherence with an increase of the relative energy spread value was observed. This analysis shows that, to reach the diffraction limit for high photon energies, electron beam emittance should go down to 1 pm rad and below.},

@article{Geloni2015,
    abstract = {The maximum of the Wigner distribution (WD) of synchrotron radiation (SR) fields is considered as a possible definition of SR source brightness. Such a figure of merit was originally introduced in the SR community by Kim [(1986), Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A , 246 , 71–76]. The brightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometrical optics limit, can be interpreted as the maximum density of photon flux in phase space. For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the WD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with a finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of a single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons in phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and electron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction angle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are intermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam divergence dominate. In these asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach is still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once more to the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate regimes a significant numerical disagreement is found between exact calculations and the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in the literature. The WD formalism is extended to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a bending magnet. It is found that in the intermediate regimes the usually accepted approximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent even parametrically.},

The method is based on the results of statistical optics and gives both the beam size and transverse coherence length at any distance behind an optical element. In particular, here Gaussian Schell-model beams and thin optical elements are considered. Limiting cases of incoherent and fully coherent illumination of the focusing element are discussed. The effect of the beam-defining aperture, typically used in combination with focusing elements at synchrotron sources to improve transverse coherence, is also analyzed in detail. As an example, the coherence properties in the focal region of compound refractive lenses at the PETRA III synchrotron source are analyzed.},

A simple analysis is shown here, however, to give an excellent prediction of the associated errors in modeling the diffraction of a collimated beam. Further, the error estimates are presented as a universal contour map where only the contour labels depend on the aperture-size-to-wavelength ratio. The inaccuracy of the Kirchhoff boundary conditions effectively sets error bounds that are essential in deriving this universal map.},

The two-dimensional local propagation integral is solved analytically for an integration domain enclosed between two mutually perpendicular line segments and a parabolic arc. We show that, by combining rectangular and arched elements, one can achieve accurate computation of the field diffracted at complicated aperture shapes without having to resort to time-consuming numerical quadrature techniques. The numerical accuracy and the computational speed of the algorithm are assessed and compared with the performance of the linear-phase approximation method developed by Hopkins and Yzuel $\backslash$[ Opt.

The case of ultimate storage rings where the electron emittance is comparable to the emittance of the photon fan is analyzed by means of the cross spectral density and the coherent mode spectrum. The proposed method permits naturally the statistical analysis and propagation of the cross spectral density along the beamline optics. The coherence properties of the X-ray beam at any point of the beamline are completely given in terms of the eigenvalues and coherent modes of the cross spectral density.},

The in-plane wavevector is a local function and accurately describes the average phase distribution in a partially coherent wavefield. The improved MOI code is demonstrated by beam propagation through free space and non-ideal mirrors. The improved MOI code can provide more accurate results with lower numbers of elements, and thus has a higher calculation efficiency. Knowledge of the in-plane wavevector also enables detailed studies of wavefield information under different coherence conditions. The improved MOI code is available at http://www.moixray.cn.},

@article{Meng2017,
    abstract = {The mutual optical intensity (MOI) model is extended to include the propagation of partially coherent radiation through non-ideal mirrors. The propagation of the MOI from the incident to the exit plane of the mirror is realised by local ray tracing. The effects of figure errors can be expressed as phase shifts obtained by either the phase projection approach or the direct path length method. Using the MOI model, the effects of figure errors are studied for diffraction-limited cases using elliptical cylinder mirrors. Figure errors with low spatial frequencies can vary the intensity distribution, redistribute the local coherence function and distort the wavefront, but have no effect on the global degree of coherence. The MOI model is benchmarked against HYBRID and the multi-electron Synchrotron Radiation Workshop ( SRW ) code. The results show that the MOI model gives accurate results under different coherence conditions of the beam. Other than intensity profiles, the MOI model can also provide the wavefront and the local coherence function at any location along the beamline. The capability of tuning the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency makes the MOI model an ideal tool for beamline design and optimization.},
